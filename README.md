# Reddit-Shorts

This program takes a random reddit post from r/AskReddit and uses the Reddit API to store the post title and body. It then changes the text into speech and stores it as mp4 files. It then gathers screenshots of the post and also cuts out a background video. Finally, the background video, screenshots, and audio are combined together to create a video. The video can then posted as a short to any social media platform.
